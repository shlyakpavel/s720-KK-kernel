= 3.4.67 kernel source code for Lenovo s720 and Philips w832 (MT6577) =
=======================================================================

*************************************
* NOTE: This kernel is for KK 4.4.2 *
*************************************

In order to get kernel compilation working, make sure you follow one of these steps:

- You have 3 folders: kernel, mediatek and prebuilts.
  - kernel folder is the basic one, with the linux kernel sources.
  - mediatek folder contains dependences that are necessary to build for MTK platform.
  - prebuilts folder should contain the appropriate cross-compiler. I use the one from Linaro http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.1-2017.05/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-7.1.1-2017.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz


- In Terminal, cd to kernel folder:
  -- Edit mbldenv.sh to set the path to your toolchain if different

- Make sure you have ccache installed
  -- You can install it with dnf or apt. The another option is to disable it in kernel Makefile

- To begin with the build process:
  -- Go back to project root folder
  -- Run command: ./makeMtk lenovo77_s720 n k to compile lenovo s720 kernel
  -- Run command: ./makeMtk w832 n k to compile Philips W832 kernel

- Once finished, you will find:
  -- The new kernel file in the folder "/out/Download/flash/"
  -- Rename the new kernel file "kernel_lenovo77_s720.bin" to "kernel"

- Create new boot.img:
  -- Repack the new generated kernel file with ramdisk.

Enjoy!
